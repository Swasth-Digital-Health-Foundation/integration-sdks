# HCX Integration SDK Repository

The Swasth Digital Health Foundation is dedicated to improving healthcare access and quality through the use of technology. This [repository](https://github.com/Swasth-Digital-Health-Foundation/hcx-platform/wiki/HCX-Integration-SDK-User-Manual) contains software development kits (SDKs) primarily for integrating with the HCX's platform. The SDKs provide developers with the necessary tools and libraries to interact with the platform's APIs and services, enabling seamless integration.

Currently, the following SDKs are available with respective library for seamless integration with the HCX's APIs:

1. Java SDK
2. .NET SDK
3. JavaScript SDK
