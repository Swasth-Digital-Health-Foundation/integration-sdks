# With actual counterparty

To test and validate the incoming API call with the actual counterparty, integration system details (encryption\_cert, endpoint\_url etc,.) should be updated in the Sandbox participant registry.

Once the registry is updated with the participant details, the request payload with x-hcx-recipent\_code having your identifier will be sent to the integration system API service.
