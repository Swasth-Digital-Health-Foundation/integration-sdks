# Pre-authorization cycle

Providers and payers need to test this API pair (/preauth/submit & /preauth/on\_submit) to submit pre-authorization requests through HCX gateway and get the pre-auth responses.&#x20;

The pre-auth response can be complete or partial as per payer adjudication process. Also, the providers can send updated/enhanced pre-auth requests to the payer with an identifier as reference to the previous request.
