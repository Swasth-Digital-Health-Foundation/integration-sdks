For functional testing of the participant-HCX integration we need to focus on key business cases/scenarios in each of the cycles. We need to test the success and failure scenarios for each step in the workflows (including forward and redirect) listed in the HCX protocol [here](https://docs.hcxprotocol.io/hcx-technical-specifications/open-protocol/key-components-building-blocks/exchange-protocol).
