* **Essential APIs:** We'll work together towards specific APIs that are critical for data exchange needs. These APIs may encompass functionalities like coverage checks, pre-authorizations, claim submissions and communication requests.
* **Leverage the Power of SDKs:** Use the provided SDKs to streamline API interaction within your chosen programming language. These SDKs typically offer functionalities for:
  * Making API calls: Sending HTTP requests to HCX endpoints.
  * Secure Communication: Including necessary headers (e.g., client key and secret) for secure communication.
  * Data Transformation: Converting data between your internal format and the FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format supported by HCX.
  * Error Handling: Implementing appropriate mechanisms to capture and manage potential errors during API communication.
  * Java, .net, python, java script&#x20;
* **Test, Test, Test:** Conduct thorough unit tests for each API integration component to ensure individual functionalities operate as expected.
* **Bringing it All Together:** Perform comprehensive integration tests to verify seamless data exchange between your system and the HCX platform. This involves running diverse test cases (e.g., successful/failed requests, different data types, edge cases) to ensure everything works smoothly.
