# Step 4: Test Drive with Reference Apps (Validation)

* **Practice Makes Perfect:** Utilize the HCX-provided reference applications as a valuable testing ground before conducting real-world participant testing. These reference apps simulate the behavior of different participants (e.g., Payer, Provider), allowing you to refine your integration and validate its functionality in a controlled environment.
* **Think of Every Scenario:** Execute a comprehensive set of test cases derived from diverse scenarios (e.g., positive/negative responses, error handling, data exchange integrity) using the reference apps.
