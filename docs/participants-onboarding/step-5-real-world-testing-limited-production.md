# Step 5: Real-World Testing (Limited Production)

* **Sandbox Access Granted:** Request access to the HCX sandbox environment. This environment mirrors the production system but uses anonymized data, allowing you to test your integration with real HCX participants under controlled conditions without impacting real-world transactions.
* **Interact with Real Participants (Limited Scale):** Engage with a select group of real HCX participants (e.g., providers/payers) to conduct limited testing in the sandbox environment. This facilitates further refinement of your integration and helps identify any unexpected issues before transitioning to full production.
