# Communication Workflows

**Communication workflow:** Payers can initiate and providers can respond to communication requests within the HCX platform. This enables secure exchange of information related to claims, such as clarification requests, additional documentation needs, or general inquiries. The platform facilitates efficient communication, promoting transparency and reducing processing delays.
