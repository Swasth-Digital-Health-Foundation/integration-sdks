# Business Workflow Categories

HCX supports two primary categories of business workflows:

1. **Claim Processing Workflows:** These workflows encompass the core processes involved in managing healthcare claims, from initial eligibility checks to final payment settlements.
2. **Communication Workflows:** These workflows facilitate secure information exchange between participants regarding claims, clarifications, and other healthcare-related matters.
