# Claim Processing Workflows

* **Coverage Eligibility Check:** Providers can initiate a cashless claim's coverage eligibility check with the payer system. This crucial step verifies a patient's coverage for the requested service before claim submission, ensuring accurate claim processing and reducing potential denials.
* **Pre-authorization and Claim Submission:** Providers can submit pre-authorization and claim requests to the payer system through the HCX platform. Pre-authorization requests seek approval for specific services before they are rendered, while claim submissions formally request reimbursement for services already provided.
* **Payment Acknowledgement:** Providers can acknowledge payment notification requests received from the payer system, confirming receipt of claim settlements. This helps maintain accurate financial records and facilitates claim closure.
* **Notification API:** The Notification API allows for communication between providers and the payer system. Providers can receive notifications about claim status updates, payment acknowledgments and other relevant events. This enables them to stay informed and take timely actions.
* **Claim Status API:** Providers can retrieve the status of their submitted claims at any stage of the claim cycle. This allows them to track claim progress, identify potential issues, and proactively address any discrepancies.
